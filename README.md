# Pazaak

## Description

For our first year assignment we needed to make the game Pazaak. Pazaak is a card game situated in the Star Wars universe.
First we needed to make a console application and later a JavaFX version using the same underlying code.
Below you can also find a video gameplay of our version of the game. At the moment the game uses a local database connection so if you would want to try the game yourself you can send me an email at geers.jelle@gmail.com and I will send the database SQL script.
